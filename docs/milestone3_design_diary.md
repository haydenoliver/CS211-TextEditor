I am a bit behind on milestone 3. I am just now making it where a text file is correctly shown on the screen without any words being cut off. I plan to keep track of what is happening on the screen next. I am behind because I believe I was going at the project in the wrong direction. I have sort of restarted by putting the text inside of a window because I was not doing that at first.
